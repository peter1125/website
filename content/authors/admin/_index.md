I am a Data Scientist at [Nationwide](https://www.nationwide.com/), where I conduct analysis and build predictive models.  
In May 2023, I graduated with a Ph.D. Sociology from [The Ohio State University]((https://sociology.osu.edu/)). where I was advised by [Sam Clark](http://www.samclark.net/). My dissertation was titled "Computational Social Science for Sociological Research}". I was also a part of the [openVA](http://openva.net/) team, where I developed software and tools for global health.

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a Consultant and advised numerous MNEs on corporate sustainability as well as global business.

I am currently based in Columbus, Ohio and enjoy playing tennis and golf in my free time.
